# azure-blob-upload

Simple Flask app that allows upload to an azure blob using an upload string with a SAS token, for users who do not like ‘azcopy’

See it in action: https://workspace-upload.herokuapp.com/ **Note:** it may take 10-15 seconds to lad first time, that is normal. Heroku free apps go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.

To try it you need a blob storage container and generate an upload string with a SAS token.
